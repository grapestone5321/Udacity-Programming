## 2. Client-Server Communication
byGoogle

HTTP/1 to HTTP/2 and all things Security


We use websites all the time, but how does clicking a link in your browser or typing in a URL in the address bar get you to a website? 

How does the server know what information you're looking for or how to send you that information once it's figured that out? 

How can you protect your users from attackers? Dig into this course and you'll be able to answer these questions!

This course will guide you through how a client communicates with a server. 

You'll learn about HTTP's request and response cycle, dig into HTTP headers and verbs, distinguish HTTP/1 from HTTP/2 capabilities, all while experiencing the importance of security by digging into the details of HTTPS. 

Throughout the course, you'll learn both security best practices, as well as ways to improve the performance of your web apps. 

We'll provide you with handcrafted servers where you'll diagnose problematic server setups, issues with SSL certificates, and even have a chance to hack an example bank website to transfer funds.
